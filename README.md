M1: MLOps Foundations
Objective: Understand the basics of MLOps and implement a simple CI/CD pipeline.
Tasks:
	1.	Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline:
	•	Use a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to set up a pipeline for a sample machine learning project.
	•	Include stages for linting, testing, and deploying a simple machine learning model.
	2.	Version Control:
	•	Implement version control for your project using Git.
	•	Demonstrate branching, merging, and pull requests.
Deliverables:
	•	A report detailing the CI/CD pipeline stages.
	•	Screenshots or logs showing successful runs of the pipeline.
	•	A Git repository link with branches and merge history.

M2: Process and Tooling
Objective: Gain hands-on experience with popular MLOps tools and understand the processes they support.
Tasks:
	1.	Experiment Tracking:
	•	Use MLflow to track experiments for a machine learning project.
	•	Record metrics, parameters, and results of at least three different model training runs.
	2.	Data Versioning:
	•	Use DVC (Data Version Control) to version control a dataset used in your project.
	•	Show how to revert to a previous version of the dataset.
Deliverables:
	•	MLflow experiment logs with different runs and their results.
	•	A DVC repository showing different versions of the dataset.

M3: Model Experimentation and Packaging
Objective: Train a machine learning model, perform hyperparameter tuning, and package the model for deployment.
Tasks:
	1.	Hyperparameter Tuning:
	•	Use a library like Optuna or Scikit-learn’s GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning on a chosen model.
	•	Document the tuning process and the best parameters found.
	2.	Model Packaging:
	•	Package the best-performing model using tools like Docker and Flask.
	•	Create a Dockerfile and a simple Flask application to serve the model.
Deliverables:
	•	A report on hyperparameter tuning results.
	•	A Dockerfile and Flask application code.
	•	Screenshots of the model running in a Docker container.
